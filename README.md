# iTip
This is my tip calculator excercise

Time spent: 4 hours -> unknown

Completed user stories:

[] Required: User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

[] Required: Settings page to change the default tip percentage. (It works pretty well now, see the settings page)

[] Optional: Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

[] Opitonal: Animating Main View

Additional features:

[] Using camera for inputting bill amount by using tesseract OCR (See the video, it works really bad in the real situation but at least, it works! :))

[] Unit Test and UI Test: Some demo test cases for the app.
